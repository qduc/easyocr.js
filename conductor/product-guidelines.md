# Product Guidelines - easyocr.js

## Prose Style
- **Technical and Precise:** Documentation, code comments, and error messages must prioritize accuracy and technical detail. 
- **Clarity and Correctness:** Ensure that technical explanations are unambiguous and directly reflect the underlying implementation.

## Development Philosophy
- **Idiomatic JavaScript/TypeScript:** The codebase should follow modern TypeScript best practices, prioritizing patterns that are natural to the JS/TS ecosystem over strict adherence to the Python reference's internal structure.
- **Developer-Centric Errors:** Error messages should be descriptive and provide enough context for a developer to diagnose issues without deep diving into the source code.

## Visual Identity & Branding
- **Minimalist and Professional:** Any documentation or generated assets should maintain a clean, professional aesthetic that emphasizes utility and performance.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent naming conventions across the monorepo, ensuring a unified feel between the core, node, and web packages.
